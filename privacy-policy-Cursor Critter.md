# Privacy Policy for Cursor Critter

**Last updated:** November 10, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how **Screen Companions** (published by **Lavrik Game Studio**) handles information. We designed this extension to respect your privacy by default.

---

## TL;DR
- We **do not collect**, store, or sell personal data.
- The extension **does not track** you across sites and **does not run analytics**.
- Settings (like chosen companion, size, and mode) are stored **locally in your browser** via Chrome storage.
- The extension requests only the minimal permissions: **storage** (to save settings) and **activeTab** (to display the on‑page companion when you open the popup).

---

## What data do we collect?
We **do not collect** any personal information, browsing history, or usage metrics. The extension does not transmit any data to external servers owned by us or third parties.

### Local settings
The following preferences are stored **locally** using Chrome's storage:
- Selected companion and unlock status
- Size slider value
- Position mode (follow cursor / static corner)
- Enable/disable toggle
- Other UI preferences

These values never leave your device unless you choose to sync your Chrome profile, in which case Chrome may sync them **end‑to‑end** according to your Google account settings.

### Custom GIFs
If you load your own animated GIFs, they are referenced **locally** by the extension. We do **not** upload, transmit, or otherwise share these files.

---

## Permissions
- **storage** — Used to save your extension settings and unlock progress.
- **activeTab** — Temporarily allows the extension to interact with the current tab **only after you click the extension icon**. We do not read page content for any purpose other than placing/animating the on‑screen companion; no data is collected, stored, or transmitted.

The extension **does not** request or use permissions like `tabs`, `history`, `cookies`, `identity`, or remote host permissions.

---

## Network requests
The extension does not perform background network requests. It only loads its own bundled assets (e.g., GIFs) or any custom GIFs you choose to supply locally.

---

## Children’s privacy
Screen Companions does not target children and knowingly does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13 (or the age defined by your local law).

---

## Data retention
Because we do not collect personal data, there is nothing for us to retain on our servers. Local settings remain on your device until you remove the extension or clear site/extension data in your browser.

---

## Security
We follow the principle of **data minimization**. With no server‑side collection and only local settings storage, your risk exposure is reduced. Still, you should keep your browser up to date and install extensions only from trusted sources.

---

## Your choices
- You can disable the companion at any time via the toggle in the popup.
- You can reset or remove stored settings by removing the extension data or uninstalling the extension.
- If you use Chrome sync, you may control what is synced in your Google account settings.

---

## International transfers
No data is transferred internationally by us because we do not collect data.

---

## Changes to this policy
If we make material changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the extension after changes means you accept the revised policy.
